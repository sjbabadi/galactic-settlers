[Here](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/) is a really nice cheat sheet for git commands and some 
best practices that will make our lives a lot easier.

[This one](http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=remote_repo;) is interactive and also gives a better look at how all of the different pieces/aspects of source control work together. Highly recommend spending a few minutes with it.

[This one](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/cheat-sheets/vcs-workflow) is very nice overview of the workflow and some general concepts like local vs. remote, what are branches, file staging, etc.
